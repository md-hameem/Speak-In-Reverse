Project: Find the Most Frequent Ones Digit In A Batch of Integers

Requirements：
(1) Given a batch of integers, analyze each digit of each integer and find the digit with the most occurrences. For example, given three integers 1234, 2345, and 3456, the numbers with the most occurrences are 3 and 4, both of which occur three times.
(2) Input format: please let the user give a positive integer N (N<=1000) in the first line through the keyboard, and also give N positive integers not exceeding the integer range in the second line, separated by spaces.
(3) Output format: in one line, output in the format of “M: n1 n2 ...”, where M is the maximum number of times, and “n1 n2 ...” are the most frequently occurring numbers, arranged in order from small to large. The numbers are separated by spaces, but no extra spaces are allowed at the end.

For example:
Input:
3
1234 2345 3456
Output:
3: 3 4
